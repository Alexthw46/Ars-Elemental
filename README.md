# Ars Nouveau 2021 Winter Addon-athon

Starts November 23rd, to December 31st 2021. For help developing your addon, questions about the API, or to get ideas from the community, join the discord! https://discord.gg/y7TMXZu
Ars Nouveau features an extensive API for addons, as well as this repo that you can fork and start immediately! Any type of addon is eligible! Think up some new glyphs, rituals, source generation, or summons!

**Rules**

Eligible mods must be publicly available by the 31st for voting. They must have Ars Nouveau as a core dependency. If you have already started an addon, you can submit it as long as it is still in development and not yet released publicly.

All submitted mods, at the authors discretion, will be entered into a public vote for the chance to win one of three $30 Redbubble gift cards! Use these to pick up some Ars Nouveau merch, or from other mods hosted on RedBubble like Botania! To enter your mod for voting, you may DM it to me or post it here to request to be added to the list.
